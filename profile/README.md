Our research deals with water and climate:
  - Water in its various forms, be it liquid or solid, and in different locations, such as above or below ground.
  - Climate change in mountain regions and its impacts on the water cycle. 

Why AQUAELUM? The acronym is a combination of the latin words for water (aqua) and air/climate (caelum).
